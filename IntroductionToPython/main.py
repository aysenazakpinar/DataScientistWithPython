# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1
result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7
print(result)

# Calculate result


# Print out result

# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

#Guess the type
#To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value,
# you can use the type() function. Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable.
# To determine the type of a, simply execute:
#  type(a)
#We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c.
# You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

#Instructions
#Possible Answers
# 1- a is of type int, b is of type str, c is of type bool
# 2- a is of type float, b is of type bool, c is of type str
# 3- a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool
# 4- a is of type int, b is of type bool, c is of type str

savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1 = savings * growth_multiplier

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float

pi_float = float(pi_string)
